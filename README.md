This is a Vandalism Detection in Wikipedia Project.
The folder DataSet1 contains following things:

(Source: Database provided by VEWS (Srijan et al.), PAN 2010, PAN 2011 Dataset, and Data extracted from Wikipedia)
2) Python codes for analyzing the Database,to find various behavioral features
3) Individual database files(.csv) created for each feature after analyzing them
4) Python codes for training the system to learn the analyzed data using many machine learning algorithms
5) Models created from learning after applying various algorithms

The folder WikiVandalism contains:
1) C# files to create an interface for the detection tool.
2) C# files which shows the result of various algorithms on testing data.
3) Learned models.


I would specially like to thank Srijan et al. for guiding me whenever I was stuck in this project.
